        <p>My name is Bela Gadsby, and I am a sophomore at Syracuse University's iSchool, studying Innovation, Society & Technology, with concentrations in Digital Retail Strategies and Web Design & Management. Technology has enabled retail to become ubiquitous and I am fascinated by the blurring of the lines between commerce and entertainment. All digital platforms are now providing consumers options to buy instantly while retailers, increasingly, are becoming entertainers. This is the intersection I hope to explore, from understanding consumer expectations to knowing how brands can design experiences that are human-centric and relevant. I am interested in content, social media, data and insights, design, and project management.</p> 
        <p>This semester, I am interning with <strong>Publicis Groupe</strong>, specifically their Commerce department. Publicis Commerce is a Groupe-level business unit specializing in Commerce Strategy and products, meaning they work across all brands, clients, and verticals to drive their commerce business. I also worked with InclusiveU at Syracuse last semester as a student support assistant. Additionally, on campus I am involved with the Women's Network, and my sorority Kappa Alpha Theta, where I am a part of the design team. I am also an iSchool leadership scholar, which has been a really rewarding opportunity already.</p> 
        <p>Outside of school, I love:</p>
             <ol>
                <li>Fashion</li> 
                <li>Thrifting</li>
                <li>Spending time with friends</li>
                <li>Any activity where I get to use my creativity</li>
             </ol>
             <p>Recently, I have been enjoying video and photo editing. Other than a career in digital retail strategy, I have long dreamed of starting my own clothing brand sometime down the line. My parents always recall my dream job as a kid was to be a Designer x Chef x Actress. I have been full of ambition since I was a young kid, and I am excited for my future at Syracuse and beyond.</p>
