    <h3>Fire</h3>
    <b><h4>Aries, Leo, Sagittarius</h4></b>
    <p>Fire signs are passionate and bold, known for their high energy personalities. Natural charmers, these signs are charismatic, and good at taking over the energy of a room. Often associated with being the center of attention, fire signs tend to possess a magnetic social energy. However, these signs bold personalities can translate as aggressive, and their big personalities can come across as vein and egotistical.</p><br>
    </div>

    <div class= "air">
    <h3>Air</h3>
    <b><h4>Gemini, Libra, Aquarius</h4></b>
    <p>Air signs are the element of intellect. Known for their strong social skills, these signs are often the life of the party, as they can talk about anything with anyone. They are great communicators and tend to think things through with logic instead of emotion. With that being said, as logic rules their communication, these signs can come off as cold or capricious, as they tend to act on what’s rational or fair, and not consider how their blunt thinking can hurt others feelings.</p><br>

    <div class="waterearth">
    <div class= "water">
    <h3>Water</h3>
    <b><h4>Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces</h4></b>
    <p>Water signs are well known for their highly emotional nature, and strong intuition. Water is the element of emotions, meaning these signs are often highly in tune with their own emotions, whether they express them or not. This also tends to make them highly compassionate, with a strong ability to sense the emotions of others. Water signs are known for their dreamy nature and tend to be creative people. As they are ruled by their emotions, this can make these signs very sensitive and moody, allowing themselves to get easily hurt.</p><br>
    </div>

    <div class ="earth">
    <h3>Earth</h3>
    <b><h4>Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn</h4></b>
    <p>Earth signs are known for their grounding energy, often associated with a practical and loyal nature. They are patient and reliable, as they are not easily angered, and can always be counted on to deliver what they promise. On the other hand, these signs can be incredibly stubborn, and if it means they get to prove their point or be right, they love to let you know when you are wrong</p><br>
