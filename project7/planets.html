    <p>When talking about astrology, many people only recognize their Sun sign, commonly referred to as their zodiac sign or star sign. However, astrology is much more nuanced than just a Sun sign and when analyzing the big six placements, one can discover a much more detailed explanation of themselves through the stars. While a full birth chart takes into account more than just the big six placements, we will be focusing on the big six to gain a better understanding of how to read your chart, and what your different placements mean. The big six placements include ones rising, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars. Below I will go into more detail about what each of these planets mean.</p><br>

    <div class= "allplanets">
    <h2>Rising</h2>
    <p>Your rising sign, also known as your ascendent, comes from the zodiac sign that was on the Eastern horizon at the time you were born. It is how you see the world and how people generally see you. It can be thought of as your social personality and the impression you leave on others, upon meeting them. More than that though, your rising sign represents your physical body and appearance, with many common physical traits that can be attributed to each different rising sign.</p><br>

    <h2>Sun</h2>
    <p>Your Sun sign, sometimes referred to as star sign, comes from the position of the Sun on the day that you were born. Your Sun is thought of as your identity, and how you express the truest version of yourself at your core. It represents the strongest personality traits that describe you and dictates your purpose in life. Your Sun sign also represents your ego, as it provides the drive behind the way you choose to act.</p><br>

    <h2>Moon</h2>
    <p>Your Moon sign, correlates to the placement of the Moon the day that you were born. Your Moon sign is the driving force behind your emotions. It is the soul of your identity and represents the subconscious side of your personality, that you may keep hidden from the general public. More than that, your Moon sign symbolizes your style of need, and what you find comfort in. It also is tied to your defense mechanisms, and maternal relationships, impacting how you tend to the needs of your inner child, and the influence your maternal figures had on you when growing up.</p><br>

    <h2>Mercury</h2>
    <p>Your Mercury sign, comes from the position the planet of Mercury was in at your time of birth. Because Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun, this sign is often the same as your Sun sign, or in the sign that comes before or after it. Mercury is known as the planet of communication, and is the sign that impacts how you communicate, process information, your intellect, and how you express yourself creatively. Essentially, Mercury is the planet that rules your voice, and can be telling in how to harness your voice to express yourself and thoughts to the fullest potential. Ever heard someone say Mercury is in retrograde? When Mercury is in retrograde, people tend to experience problems with communication, and often that manifests in technology based problems. This past retrograde from January 13 to February 3 of 2022, can you think of any communication problems you experienced? I know Syracuse University had many problems with getting the AirOrangeX Wi-Fi to cooperate during these datesâ€¦</p><br>

    <h2>Venus</h2>
    <p>Your Venus sign comes from the location of Venus in the sky, at the time you were born. The planet of Venus represents all things love and beauty. It is the planet that rules your romantic expression, like how you flirt or how you show your love to friends, family, or significant others. But it also represents how you like to be loved. More than that Venus symbolizes your aesthetic and taste, as it is where you find beauty in life. It represents personal style, and how you express yourself artistically. Venus also manifests in how you experience pleasure and where you find pleasure in life.</p><br>

    <h2>Mars</h2>
    <p>Your Mars sign correlates to the placement of Mars at the time of your birth. The planet Mars represents your drive in life, and is concerned with your motivations, passions, and the energy you feel towards those things. It dictates your instincts of aggression and anger, your competitive nature, and influences your sexual drive or desires. Mars can show you what makes you angry, and how you react to that anger. It is different from the Sun in that Mars is your instinctual motivation for acting on things, like getting up in the morning , while your Sun sign is your motivation for how you want to live out your life, and is more will based.</p><br>
